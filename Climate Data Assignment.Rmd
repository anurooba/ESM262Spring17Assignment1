# Rearrange the data so that the temperature and precipitation can be averaged over month and year.
# It is relatively easy to collapse data in R using one or more BY variables and a defined function.
# aggregate data frame climate by years and months, returning means for numeric variables
# More information and example  @ http://www.statmethods.net/management/aggregate.html
# After aggregating the group columns are added to the table, hence the column reference should be based on the aggredate data table rather than the original table.

# Aggregate the data by month and year to calculate the mean of the max and min temperatures

#View(climate) # If included, this is not in the Rmarkdown report by gets generated while knitting.

#Climate Analysis based on Seasonal Changes

# creating seasons - group by certain months . Spring is 1, Summer is 2, Fall is 3, Winter is 4

climate2$Season <- ifelse(climate2$month <= 5 & climate2$month >= 3, 1, ifelse(climate2$month <= 8, 2,(ifelse(climate2$month <= 11, 3, 4))))

# Wettest Season (season of maximum rainfall) and Driest Season (season of minimum rainfall)

# Aggregate the data by season and year to calculate the sum of rainfall per season

ClimateSeasonAgg<- aggregate(climate2,by=list(climate2$Season,climate2$year),FUN="sum")

#location of the season with maximum rainfall in the dataframe

WettestSeason=which.max(ClimateSeasonAgg$rain)

# Display the complete the record

#type cast the rain amount 

ClimateSeasonAgg$Season=as.integer(ClimateSeasonAgg$Group.1)
ClimateSeasonAgg$year=as.integer(ClimateSeasonAgg$Group.2)
ClimateSeasonAgg$rain=as.integer(ClimateSeasonAgg$rain)

# Display the season of maximum rain and amount of Rain

ClimateSeasonAgg[WettestSeason,c("Season","year","rain")]

#location of the season with minimum rainfall on the data frame

## Relationship between Winter Precipitation and Summer Temperature 

PrecipSeasonAgg <- aggregate(climate2, by=list(climate2$Season, climate2$year), FUN="mean")

# Calculate the average temperature of the season per year

PrecipSeasonAgg$Temperature <- (PrecipSeasonAgg$tmax + PrecipSeasonAgg$tmin)/2

# Consider only the Summer

SummerTemp <- subset(PrecipSeasonAgg, Season == 2)

#Consider only two attributes year and temperature from the data for summer

SummerTemp1 <- SummerTemp[,c(2,10)]

#Rename the column name
colnames(SummerTemp1) <- c("Year", "Temperature")


# Consider only the Winter

WinterPrecip <- subset(PrecipSeasonAgg, Season == 4)

#Consider only two attributes year and precipitation from the data for summer

WinterPrecip1 <- WinterPrecip[,c(2,5)]

#Rename the column name
colnames(WinterPrecip1) <- c("Year", "Precipitation")

# Merge summer and winter data from table.
CompareTempPrecip <- merge(SummerTemp1, WinterPrecip1,by="Year")

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(CompareTempPrecip, aes(Temperature, Precipitation))+
     geom_point(shape=1, color="darkred", size=2)+
     labs(title="Relationship between Winter Precipitation & Summer Temerature (1942- 2016)", x="Temperature in Celcius", y ="Precipitation in Centimeters", family="Times New Roman") +
     theme_bw() +
     theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank())

## Relationship Analysis Based on the above figure

# Although there are some outliers , high precipitation at low temperatures and low precipitation at high temperatures, based on the above graph we can say that at mid temperatures there are ample chances of precipitation both light and heavy included. Hence providing an insight as to how any year with summers with non extreme temperature fluxes indicates rainfall in winters for those years.
